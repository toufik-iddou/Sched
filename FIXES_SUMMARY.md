3. Set environment variables:
   ```env
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your-16-character-app-password
   ```

### Google Calendar Setup
1. Create a Google Cloud Project
2. Enable Google Calendar API
3. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
4. Set environment variables:

   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
   GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5000/auth/google/callback
   ```

## Testing Your Configuration

### 1. Run Configuration Test
```bash
cd server
npm run test-config
```

### 2. Test via API Endpoint

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/booking/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"testEmail": true, "testCalendar": true}'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Email Issues
- Check that you're using an App Password, not your regular Gmail password

- Check the server logs for detailed error messages

### Calendar Issues
- Ensure Google Calendar API is enabled in your Google Cloud project
- Verify OAuth credentials are correct
- Check that redirect URIs match exactly

### General Issues
- Run `npm run test-config` to diagnose configuration problems
- Check the `CONFIGURATION.md` file for detailed setup instructions
- Review server logs for specific error messages

## Next Steps

1. **Set up your environment variables** following the `CONFIGURATION.md` guide
2. **Run the configuration test** to verify everything is working
3. **Test a booking** to see the full email and calendar integration
4. **Monitor the logs** to ensure everything is functioning properly

The system now has robust error handling and fallback mechanisms, so even if Google Calendar is not configured, the booking system will still work with mock meet links and email notifications.
